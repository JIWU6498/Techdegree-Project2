# Techdegree Project2 - Mobile First Responsive Website
#### Skills: HTML, CSS
#### Tools: W3C CSS & HTML validator
#### Concept: mobile-first responsive website
#### Description: Build a responsive,mobile-first layout using HTML and CSS. This layout demonstrates my understanding of responsive design by adjusting to accommodate small, medium and large screen sizes. I wrote CSS to style the page for the small mobile device first and then use min-width media queries. I also add breakpoints to adjust the layout for wider tablet and desktop screens.
